                <p>
                    I am Keniel and this is what you need to know about me; I am a well organized and
                    discplined indiviual who is always trying to do better than his previous self. 
                    I always strive to never be brought down by my suroundings and I almost always try
                    not to get mad. I go to an Early College because I thought it would be a great oppurtunity and I was right.
                    Thankfully I did go through with this descision since I have strived through my coding carrer and continue to learn and build upon my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my future I want to develop my coding carrer and continue to code and then move up to more advanced things like game and other things similar. 
                    I want to stive big and what Im striving for is to build the next game that has bigger numbers than Fortnite. I want to be the main coder on this game and 
                    make a lot of money throught this journey. Im very amitious about this and I will work toward this goal until I make it, I wont back down nor give up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love to play sports this helps with me have a strong mentality, because of bad games and trash talkers, and helps my discpline because I train alot.
                    I play sports like Basketball, Volleyball, and Soccer. All these sports require team work and they have all improved mine.
